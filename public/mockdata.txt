'The site was looking good—and fast, thanks to a carefully tweaked Bootstrap template. But when the time came to deploy, this mysterious error popped up only on the deployed Heroku version. Hours of prodding ensued. In the end, I took it as a lesson more in agile development than template hacking: The story section was split off into its own route and page. Want to give it a crack?
